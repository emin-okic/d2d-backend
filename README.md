# The D2D Backend Project

The `d2d-backend` powers the backend services for the D2D CRM mobile app, a tool designed to help door-to-door sales reps track leads, manage customer interactions, and log field activity efficiently.

## üöÄ Purpose

This backend provides a simple, scalable foundation for:

- User account creation and login  
- Data storage for prospects, knocks, and trips  
- API endpoints for syncing mobile data with the server  
- Cross-origin support for iOS frontend access  

## üõ† Architecture

- **Framework:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (Python microframework)  
- **API Style:** RESTful JSON  
- **CORS:** Enabled via `flask-cors` to support mobile client communication  
- **Storage:** In-memory user store (temporary; future upgrade to persistent database planned)  
- **Deployment:** Containerized with Docker + Docker Compose  

### Example Endpoints

- `POST /signup` ‚Äì Register a new user  
- `POST /login` ‚Äì Authenticate a user  
- `GET /users` ‚Äì List all users (temporary/debug endpoint)
